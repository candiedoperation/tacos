        To Initialize the PIC, send the Intialization Code.
        Both the master and slave PICs are traditionally
        initialized together.

        After a Command is sent to the PIC, write gibberish to
        port 0x80 (Linux does it this way). Why? The PIC takes
        time to process the request. We need a small timer but,
        timers work on interrupts and we're writing this block
        of code to enable interrupts. The hack involves writing
        gibbersh that takes around 1 to 4 microseconds. It's
        guaranteed that the PIC will process the request by then.
